I'm sick of being a video game! -I shout the console on the shelf- I always have to put up with the slobber of spoiled children on my controls, or the stupid comments of a fat geek who lives in his mother's basement! These losers are idiots, I hate them, they always believe themselves more than any of their kind for knowing the credits of my games, I would like to be a book. They do know how to have fun! They are always traveling from one place to another and their creative parents are highly respected geniuses, they welcome thousands of amazing characters such as Juan Pablo Castel, Lidenbrock, Alekséi Ivánovich, Demian, Gregorio Samsa and stop counting ... unlike me, that I can only boast of gorillas with ties and Italian plumbers, my life is an excessively machacón cliché, books do waver with unique and penetrating stories, books are read by lost adolescents, inveterate students of philosophy, poor devils and dreamers; I cannot boast of having such an audience, books enrich minds and soften souls, while I only feel that I kill the neurons of children. You are a lucky book!

All this was heard by the book very circumspect and it did not take long to respond, raised his voice and said:

-You don't know anything about video games! - This is an ordeal, people only read me to tell their friends that I'm better than the movie, nobody really understands me, they see thousands of complex words on my pages and they don't investigate, they pass them like Unnoticed, people give thousands of different concepts, messages and interpretations to my stories and they forget that I am just that, a story, so they confuse me a lot and I don't even know who I am! And you know very well how much that affects an existentialist! like me, Mr. Video game console! I wish I could be like you, and entertain the children, instead of boring them for having to read me to do a school essay, you make people happy, you amuse them, not me, I just accompany, make them think and depress, It is true that I also make my imagination fly, but sometimes I make it fly so high that Boom! It takes a nosedive and I turn great subjects into intellectuals, and nobody is more pedantic than an intellectual, not to mention the idiots who only take photos of me to upload them to their social networks and make themselves interesting, they are the worst, you don't know how lucky. you have a video game console.

The video game console made an irritated gesture of disapproval, suddenly the noise of the door being slammed against the wall was heard, while a child ran into the room, and with great fury he took his soccer ball and went to play games. the street articulating a smile from ear to ear, then, the video game console and the book began to talk about how lucky the soccer ball is, and they waited for it to arrive to destroy it with tricks and flattery since ... nothing confuses you More than a kind gesture from your enemy, right?
